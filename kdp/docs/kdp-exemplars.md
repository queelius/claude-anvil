## Fiction Blurb Exemplars

### Epic Fantasy

> **[HOOK]** The salt lake at the heart of the Vaesori Empire has not frozen in ten thousand years. When cartographer Elin Dath arrives to survey its shores, she finds three inches of black ice — and a city sealed beneath it.
>
> **[ESCALATION]** The Imperial Survey Corps calls it a geological anomaly. The lake-priests call it the Seal of Ending. And the figures moving beneath the ice call Elin by name.
>
> **[STAKES]** To unseal the city, Elin must betray the empire that trained her. To leave it sealed, she must ignore the voice of her dead father, who vanished on this same survey fifteen years ago. Either way, the ice is cracking.
>
> **[CTA]** *The Cartographer's Seal* is the first book in the Vaesori Cycle — an epic fantasy for readers of Katherine Arden, Robert Jordan, and anyone who believes maps can lie.

**Why this works:**
- The hook is a concrete, visual anomaly — not an abstraction. "Three inches of black ice" lands harder than "an ancient evil awakens."
- Stakes are both public (empire) and private (dead father), which creates dual tension.
- The CTA names comp authors without being sycophantic, and the last clause ("maps can lie") reinforces the cartographer premise.

### Thriller

> **[HOOK]** Fourteen hours ago, forensic accountant Mara Voss found $6.2 billion hidden in the pension fund she was hired to audit. Now her client is dead, her files are gone, and someone has booked a flight in her name to a country with no extradition treaty.
>
> **[ESCALATION]** The money belongs to people who don't lose money. Mara has one encrypted backup, a burner phone with 11% battery, and a name — *Harkin* — scrawled on a receipt her client shoved into her hand minutes before he died.
>
> **[STAKES]** If she runs, they'll find her. If she goes public, she'll need proof she no longer has. If she follows the name, she'll walk into the same room her client never walked out of.
>
> **[CTA]** A white-knuckle financial thriller for readers of Joseph Finder, Lisa Gardner, and anyone who's ever wondered where the money actually goes.

**Why this works:**
- Specificity creates credibility. "$6.2 billion" and "11% battery" are concrete details that make the scenario feel real.
- The three-option structure in the stakes paragraph ("if she runs / goes public / follows the name") presents a genuine trilemma — the reader can't see the way out.
- The blurb's pacing mirrors the genre: short clauses, no wasted words.

### Literary Fiction

> **[HOOK]** The summer Jonah Kader turned forty, he built a stone wall across his backyard. His wife said it was a project. His daughter said it was a metaphor. His therapist said nothing, which was the most expensive silence Jonah had ever paid for.
>
> **[ESCALATION]** The wall grows. So does the distance between Jonah and the family he's trying to hold together — his mother, who refuses to leave the house she can no longer maintain; his brother, who won't stop calling about selling it; and Elena, who has started sleeping on her side of a bed that used to have no sides.
>
> **[STAKES]** Set over one sweltering July in a Philadelphia row house, *The Wall Builder* is about the structures we raise to protect ourselves and the people left standing on the other side.
>
> **[CTA]** For readers of Ann Patchett, Kent Haruf, and Elizabeth Strout.

**Why this works:**
- The voice is the hook. The therapist line signals literary sensibility and dark humor in one sentence.
- No plot summary — the blurb reveals character dynamics and thematic stakes without describing events. Literary fiction readers want to know *how* the book feels, not what happens.
- The comp authors are precise and signal the lane: quiet domestic realism with emotional weight.

### Science Fiction

> **[HOOK]** In 2089, the Kuiper Array detects a signal from outside the solar system. It isn't language. It isn't mathematics. It's a shipping manifest — and Earth is listed as the destination.
>
> **[ESCALATION]** Xenolinguist Priya Chandrasekaran is pulled from academic obscurity to decode the manifest before the shipment arrives. What she finds isn't a threat. It's a delivery confirmation for something humanity ordered — placed two hundred years before the technology to place it existed.
>
> **[STAKES]** As governments race to weaponize what they don't understand, Priya must answer a question no one wants to ask: what did humanity promise, and to whom?
>
> **[CTA]** *The Manifest* is first-contact science fiction for readers of Ted Chiang, Becky Chambers, and Arrival — a novel about the contracts we sign without reading the terms.

**Why this works:**
- The concept is the hook. "A shipping manifest" subverts the first-contact trope by making the alien signal mundane and bureaucratic — which is more unsettling than a war fleet.
- The escalation deepens the mystery rather than raising the volume. Each sentence adds a new dimension to the puzzle.
- The closing line ("contracts we sign without reading the terms") doubles as thematic summary and wry humor.

## Blurb Anti-Patterns

### 1. Spoilers in the Blurb

**Bad:**
> When detective Sarah finds the killer is her own partner, she must decide whether to turn him in or help him cover up the murder of the man who abused his daughter.

**Problem:** The reveal *is* the book's engine. If the reader already knows the partner did it, the first 200 pages of investigation are dead weight.

**Fix:** Tease the discovery without naming it. "What Sarah uncovers will destroy the one person she trusts most."

### 2. Passive Voice / Weak Opening

**Bad:**
> A world is threatened by an ancient evil. A hero is chosen by destiny. A quest is undertaken that will change everything.

**Problem:** Passive construction ("is threatened," "is chosen," "is undertaken") strips all agency. Nothing feels urgent because nobody is doing anything.

**Fix:** Give the sentence a subject who acts. "When the Thornwall cracks open, seventeen-year-old Reva is the only one who hears it."

### 3. Too Much Backstory Before the Hook

**Bad:**
> In the kingdom of Aldremere, which was founded three hundred years ago after the War of the Seven Banners, there exists an ancient order of knights known as the Greyguard. The Greyguard have protected the throne for generations, but their numbers have dwindled since the Plague of Ashes, which killed nearly half the population forty years ago. Now, a young squire named Tam discovers something that could change everything...

**Problem:** Three sentences of worldbuilding before anything happens. The reader wanted a hook and got a history lecture. "Something that could change everything" is the vaguest possible stakes.

**Fix:** Open with Tam and the discovery. The worldbuilding can emerge from the blurb's action.

### 4. No Stakes / No Conflict

**Bad:**
> Follow Marina as she travels through beautiful landscapes, meets interesting people, and learns about herself along the way. A heartwarming tale of self-discovery and friendship.

**Problem:** Nothing opposes Marina. No tension, no cost, no reason to keep reading. "Heartwarming" and "self-discovery" are outcomes, not hooks.

**Fix:** Name what Marina wants, what stands in her way, and what she'll lose if she fails.

### 5. Generic Adjectives

**Bad:**
> An incredible story of one woman's amazing journey through a breathtaking world filled with unforgettable characters and jaw-dropping twists.

**Problem:** Every adjective is a superlative that communicates nothing. "Incredible," "amazing," "breathtaking," "unforgettable," and "jaw-dropping" are the verbal equivalent of exclamation marks — the more you use, the less each one means.

**Fix:** Replace evaluative adjectives with descriptive ones. Not "an incredible world" but "a world where rivers run uphill and the dead remember."

### 6. Burying the Hook

**Bad:**
> Marcus has always loved the ocean. Growing up in a small coastal town, he spent his summers diving off the pier with his best friend Jake. After college, Marcus returned home to take over his father's fishing business. He married his high school sweetheart and settled into a quiet life. Then one morning, he pulls up a net full of human bones.

**Problem:** Four sentences of setup before the hook. The bones are the blurb — everything before them is preamble the reader doesn't need yet.

**Fix:** Open with the bones. "The morning Marcus pulls a net full of human bones from the harbor, he recognizes the wedding ring tangled in the ribs."

## Keyword Strategies by Genre

### How Keywords Work on KDP

You get 7 keyword slots. Each can be a phrase (up to 50 characters). Keywords supplement your title, subtitle, and category — they help readers find your book through Amazon search. They do not appear on your listing page.

### Effective Keyword Patterns

**Genre + subgenre combinations:**
- "epic fantasy war" rather than just "fantasy"
- "psychological thriller unreliable narrator"
- "cozy mystery bakery"

**Thematic phrases readers search:**
- "enemies to lovers fantasy"
- "time loop science fiction"
- "found family adventure"

**Setting and tone markers:**
- "dark academia mystery"
- "small town romance"
- "space opera military"

**Comp-adjacent phrasing (without naming authors):**
- "books like grimdark fantasy" (not "books like Joe Abercrombie")
- "first contact hard science fiction"
- "southern gothic literary fiction"

### TOS Boundaries

- **No competitor names**: Do not use author names, book titles, or brand names as keywords.
- **No misleading terms**: If your book is not a romance, do not use romance keywords to poach traffic.
- **No title repetition**: Words already in your title/subtitle are indexed automatically. Repeating them wastes a keyword slot.
- **No subjective claims**: "best fantasy book" or "award-winning thriller" violate content guidelines.
- **No temporary claims**: "new release 2026" becomes stale and misleading within weeks.

### Example Keyword Sets

**Epic Fantasy (e.g., *The Cartographer's Seal*):**
1. epic fantasy series
2. maps and cartography adventure
3. ancient sealed city
4. fantasy with prophecy
5. empire political intrigue
6. dark fantasy quest
7. secondary world fantasy

**Domestic Thriller:**
1. domestic suspense
2. psychological thriller marriage
3. unreliable narrator
4. suburban secrets
5. missing person mystery
6. dark twisty thriller
7. suspense with female protagonist

**Literary Fiction:**
1. literary fiction family drama
2. quiet literary novel
3. domestic realism
4. father son relationship fiction
5. midlife crisis novel
6. character driven literary fiction
7. Philadelphia fiction

**Hard Science Fiction:**
1. hard science fiction first contact
2. alien signal mystery
3. xenolinguistics fiction
4. near future science fiction
5. space exploration thriller
6. science fiction puzzle
7. speculative fiction humanity

### Keyword Research Method

The fastest way to generate keyword candidates:

1. **Amazon search autocomplete**: Type your genre into the Amazon Books search bar and note what Amazon suggests. These are real, high-volume search phrases.
2. **Bestseller category browsing**: Look at the top 20 books in your target categories. Read their subtitles and descriptions for recurring phrases.
3. **"Also bought" chains**: From a comp title's page, follow the "Customers who bought this also bought" links. Note what language those books use.
4. **Keyword density check**: After drafting your 7, ask: would a reader searching *any one of these* be happy to find my book? If not, the keyword is misleading.

Avoid keyword research tools that encourage stuffing or gaming. The goal is discoverability by the right readers, not maximum impressions.

## Category Selection Examples

### The Niche-vs-Broad Trade-off

Amazon allows 2 categories at submission (3 for print). You can request up to 10 total by contacting KDP support after publication. The strategic question is depth: a narrower category has fewer competitors but also fewer browsers.

**Rule of thumb:** Go as specific as BISAC allows. You automatically appear in every parent category above your selection. Choosing "Fiction > Fantasy > Epic" places you in three browse paths (Epic, Fantasy, and Fiction) — choosing just "Fiction > Fantasy" only gives you two.

### Example BISAC Paths

**Fantasy novel with political intrigue:**
- Primary: Fiction > Fantasy > Epic
- Secondary: Fiction > Fantasy > Action & Adventure
- Post-publish request: Fiction > Political

**Psychological thriller:**
- Primary: Fiction > Thrillers > Psychological
- Secondary: Fiction > Thrillers > Suspense
- Post-publish request: Fiction > Mystery & Detective > Women Sleuths (if applicable)

**Literary fiction about family:**
- Primary: Fiction > Literary
- Secondary: Fiction > Family Life > General
- Post-publish request: Fiction > Small Town & Rural

**Hard science fiction:**
- Primary: Fiction > Science Fiction > Hard Science Fiction
- Secondary: Fiction > Science Fiction > First Contact
- Post-publish request: Fiction > Science Fiction > Space Exploration

### Post-Publish Category Requests

After your book is live, contact KDP support to add categories beyond the initial 2-3. This is a standard, supported workflow — not a hack. Provide:
- Your book's ASIN
- The specific BISAC category paths you want added
- Brief justification for fit

Most requests are approved within 48 hours. Aim for 5-8 total categories that genuinely describe your book. Adding irrelevant categories to game rankings risks a metadata review.

### Series and Category Alignment

If your book is part of a series, all books in the series should share at least one category. This keeps them grouped in browse results and strengthens the series page on Amazon. When adding post-publish categories to a new installment, match the categories of book one first, then add any new ones specific to the latest volume's content.

## Author Bio Examples

### Conventions by Genre

**Genre fiction** (fantasy, thriller, sci-fi, romance): Third person is standard. Focus on genre credentials, reading tastes, and personality. Light tone is welcome.

**Literary fiction**: Third person or first person both work. Focus on publications, awards, residencies, teaching positions. More restrained tone.

**General rules:**
- Lead with what makes you credible for *this* book.
- Skip childhood origin stories unless they're directly relevant.
- Include where you live (readers like geographic grounding).
- If you have previous publications, name them. If you don't, don't apologize for it.
- One personal detail humanizes; three personal details pad.

### Example: Genre Fiction (Fantasy)

> **Maren Cole** writes epic fantasy about people who draw maps of places that shouldn't exist. She holds a degree in medieval history from the University of Edinburgh, which she uses primarily to argue about siege logistics at dinner parties. Her debut novel, *The Cartographer's Seal*, is the first book in the Vaesori Cycle. She lives in Portland, Oregon, with two cats who have never once respected a closed door.

**What works:** The first sentence establishes genre and thematic identity. The Edinburgh detail provides credibility for the fantasy setting without being heavy-handed. The cats line is one personal detail — enough to humanize, not enough to derail.

### Example: Literary Fiction

> **Daniel Asher** is the author of *The Wall Builder* and the short story collection *Exit Wounds*, which was longlisted for the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize. His fiction has appeared in *The Southern Review*, *Tin House*, and *Ploughshares*. He teaches creative writing at Temple University and lives in Philadelphia.

**What works:** Publications and credentials lead. No personality filler — the writing speaks for itself. The Philadelphia detail connects to the novel's setting, reinforcing authenticity without stating it outright.
